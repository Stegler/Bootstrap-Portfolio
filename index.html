                    <p>I was born in Wurtzberg, Germany on October 5th 1991. Moved to Korea and lived there until I was in 5th
                            grade. I then moved to Olympia, Washington and have lived there ever since.
                            I am a younger brother to a loving older sister named Sarah. I played the trumpet and tenor saxophone
                            throughout middle school and high school. I also enjoyed playing tennis throughout high school. Decided to
                            go to college at Central Washington and graduated with a BS in Biology and minor in Chemistry.
                            I did not end up working in that field which brings me to the UW BootCamp class which I could not be more
                            excited for.</p>
